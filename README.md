# Python-Tetris

A game of Tetris made with the “graphics.py” module in python.  Functions like a normal game of Tetris, having tetranimos falling at changing speeds, taking user input to control the teranimos rotation and dropping, clearing rows and increasing the score when all ten spaces of the row are filled, and causing a game over if a new piece were to be created on top of a placed piece.
